## About me
A few words about me ... I live in Russia in the city of Nizhny Novgorod. I work as a sales representative in a local company that is a partner of Siemens DI SW and implements software products for design automation and product lifecycle management. In my spare time I study front-end development and js. My goal is to master the skills of front-end development and find jobs in this area. I have a structured mind, quickly absorb new information and focus on results. I am efficient in team work and ready to help partners if necessary. In addition to work, I lead an active lifestyle and play football and hockey, and also like to learn new things about technology, science and finance.
